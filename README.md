## App Walkthrough

1. Upon opening the app, you will see a simple and intuitive user interface with a password display area and options to customize the password generation.

2. Set the desired password length by moving the slider or manually inputting the value in the input field. The recommended password length is at least 12 characters for better security.

## Security Considerations

- The app utilizes JavaScript's built-in `Math.random()` function to generate random characters. While this is suitable for a basic password generator, it is not cryptographically secure for highly sensitive applications. If you need a more robust solution for enterprise-level security, consider using a library or service specifically designed for cryptographic purposes.

- Always use HTTPS when hosting the app to ensure secure communication between the user's browser and the server.

- Avoid storing passwords on the client-side or transmitting them over unencrypted channels.

- Encourage users to store their passwords securely using password managers.
